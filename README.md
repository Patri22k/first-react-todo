# My First React Project: Simple ToDo List

This project is a simple ToDo list application built with React. It allows you to add tasks to a list by typing them into a text field and clicking the "Add" button. Each task appears as a line of text in the list.

To remove a task, simply click the "Delete" button next to the task. This will immediately remove the task from the list.

Here's a quick overview of how the application works:
```javascript
// Add a task
1. Type your task into the text field.
2. Click the "Add" button. The task will appear in the list below.

// Remove a task
1. Find the task you want to remove in the list.
2. Click the "Remove" button next to the task. The task will be immediately removed from the list.
```
